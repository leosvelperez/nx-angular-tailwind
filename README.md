# nx-buildable-publishable-libs-tailwind

This repo showcases an existing issue when using TailwindCSS with incremental builds in an Nx workspace. The issue arises due to `ng-packagr` not supporting custom PostCSS config nor TailwindCSS (see https://github.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/issues/1943#issuecomment-820366833 and https://github.com/ng-packagr/ng-packagr/issues/1418#issuecomment-725358476).

There are two apps in the workspace setup with TailwindCSS. They both consume the same libraries and we have one non buildable library, one buildable library and one publishable library. The apps and each library contain some buttons with some TailwindCSS classes and some buttons using the `@apply` directive.

- `app1`: Uses the `@nrwl/angular:*` executors for incremental building.
- `app2`: Uses the `@angular-devkit/build-angular:*` builders.

When running `nx serve app1`, Nx will run the `app1` dependencies build target and then will build the app. As a result of this, we can check the button using the CSS class with the `@apply` directive is broken for the buildable and publishable libraries. The `@apply` directive was not expanded due to `ng-packagr` not processing it.

When running `nx serve app2`, the app will be built pulling in the code from the libs directly. As a result, all buttons are rendered correctly.

## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `ng add @nrwl/angular`
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `ng add @nrwl/web`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/community) you could add.

## Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

## Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@my-org/mylib`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

## Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
